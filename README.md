# Gallery

An open-source Android gallery app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room,
Coil, CameraX, and Media3. It organizes photos and videos by timeline, album,
location, and grid views, with search, favorites, private on-device tagging,
an in-app camera, and a restorable media Bin.

## Requirements

- Android Studio with JDK 17
- Android SDK 36
- Android 7.0 (API 24) or newer for the app

## Build

1. Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Run the `app` configuration, or build from a terminal:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
Android's normal per-developer debug signing key is used, so no keystore needs
to be committed.

## Current version

Version 1.26.0 (version code 39) keeps only the current release information here. Add Media now smoothly contracts to its plus icon whenever the timeline scrollbar is used, stays compact throughout scrollbar activity, and expands again after a short idle delay.
