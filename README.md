# Gallery

An open-source Android gallery app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room,
Coil, CameraX, and Media3. It organizes photos and videos by timeline, album,
location, and grid views, with search, favorites, private on-device tagging,
an in-app camera, and a restorable media Bin.

## Requirements

- Android Studio with JDK 17
- Android SDK 36
- Android 7.0 (API 24) or newer for the app

## Build

1. Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Run the `app` configuration, or build from a terminal:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
Android's normal per-developer debug signing key is used, so no keystore needs
to be committed.

## Current version

Version 1.19.0 (version code 32) shows the complete photo and video frame in gallery
grid cards instead of center-cropping media into the square thumbnail. This is most
noticeable for wide 16:9 captures. Camera output continues to use Android MediaStore
under `DCIM/Gallery` so captures are visible to Google Photos and other gallery apps.
