# Gallery

An open-source Android gallery app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room,
Coil, CameraX, and Media3. It organizes photos and videos by timeline, album,
location, and grid views, with search, favorites, private on-device tagging,
an in-app camera, and a restorable media Bin.

## Requirements

- Android Studio with JDK 17
- Android SDK 36
- Android 7.0 (API 24) or newer for the app

## Build

1. Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Run the `app` configuration, or build from a terminal:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
Android's normal per-developer debug signing key is used, so no keystore needs
to be committed.

## Current version

Version 1.18.0 (version code 31) saves camera captures through Android MediaStore
under `DCIM/Gallery`, making them visible to Google Photos and other gallery apps.
Photo Preview and ImageCapture now share one viewport so the saved image matches
the frame shown at the moment of capture instead of appearing unexpectedly cut.
