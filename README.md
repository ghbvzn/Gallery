# Gallery

An open-source Android gallery app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room,
Coil, CameraX, and Media3. It organizes photos and videos by timeline, album,
location, and grid views, with search, favorites, private on-device tagging,
an in-app camera, and a restorable media Bin.

## Requirements

- Android Studio with JDK 17
- Android SDK 36
- Android 7.0 (API 24) or newer for the app

## Build

1. Clone this repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Run the `app` configuration, or build from a terminal:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
Android's normal per-developer debug signing key is used, so no keystore needs
to be committed.

## Current version

Version 1.30.0 (version code 43) makes automatic media refresh incremental. Existing photos and videos reuse cached location metadata, and Room updates only records whose metadata actually changed, avoiding thousands of file reads, geocoder requests, and redundant database writes on every foreground refresh.
